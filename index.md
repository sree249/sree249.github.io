## Subhasree Sengupta

Hello! My name is Subhasree Sengupta. I am a 2nd year doctoral student at the school of information studies, Syracuse University and am advised by **Dr. Caroline Haythornthwaite**.
Prior to joining the Ischool, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Statistics from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and 
my Masters in Computer Science from University of Southern California, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and machine learning.
My research interests spans the areas of Social networks analysis,virtual communities, collaborative learning forums, 
computer mediated communication and applications of Machine learning.
My research focuses on understanding the knowledge created, shared and curated in online learning communities that focus on computing and technical learning. 
I am interested to explore how the community dynamics and knowledge shared on these platforms depends on the norms, communication modalities offered by the platforms. 
Another dimension of my research, investigates the use of online discussion forums for seeking support and building reseilence in academic settings.
